			<p>Dear Nova,</p>
			<p>Hii, I know school has ended a few days ago. And It's pretty late to write a letter right now but I'll have to write it anyway it's 'better late than never', right? (just think about Tr Nay Nwe saying this). I feel a bit weird that we're going to part ways since we've spent 3 years of school together in the same class, same year and same school. I lowkey miss laughing with you out of nowhere back in school, I miss having lunch with all of you and talking about useless shit that will never benefit us but at least it's fun (gossip). Okay, be serious again. You know, our friendship is my favorite and you've seen me through all my eras, the lover girl era, the emo ahh era, all the changes in me, you've seen them all and you're one of the rarest people who knows me really well and I really love you for that. I hope our friendship stays the same, and It will. I hope we meet can meet again after we move to different countries. Like I wish I could meet all of you (our friend group and banyar etc etc) again in somewhere nice. I want you to acknowledge that you're going to be in my prayers, I'll always pray for your goods and success (so that you can afford me a porsche heheheheh, I'm just kidding ok). Also, the most important thing is don't lose yourself over people or over situations. You should always choose your side first, you should only control the situations that you can. And, always prioritize your health more than anything else, even if you have to study, you have to sleep early and eat healthy. God is on your side, so don't lose hope as well! mwah mwah I wish you get the best life of all and can be able to meet your dream partner. I'll be a great aunt [proud_emoji]. The last thing I want to tell you is that you can talk to me anytime if you're feeling down, it's better than not talking to anyone at all or ghosting everyone so yeah please talk to me if you have problems, I'll make sure to solve those with you. Bye!</p>
			<p>Love you!!,</p>
			<p>Juli</p>
